# GTPR
Generalized Triangle Parallel Robot Repository

The Generalized Triangle Parallel Robot (GTPR) is a new type of parallel delta robot. The specialty of these types of robots are that the base and work triangles are similar triangles, but can be any type of triangles, meanwhile the lengths of the links (upper and lower) can be freely chosen, independently of each other. The advantage of this that, through this method the shape, size and the properties of the workspace can be modified.

# Simulink Model
The model needs the initial parameters of a GTPR, then it can be run. A short Tutorial is in progress for this.
